![Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Text%20Classification-blue) ![Gradio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Frontend-Gradio-orange)

A **state-of-the-art text classification app** that predicts whether a given text was written by a human or generated by a machine. Built using **BERT** and deployed with **Gradio** for easy interaction.

This project is inspired by the [**SemEval 2024 Competition**](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SemEval2024-task8) on text generation detection, showcasing modern NLP techniques in action.  

**Note:** This implementation focuses on **Subtask A (monolingual track)**, classifying texts from **English sources only**.
